# Child-Well-Being-Analysis-Ethiopia-and-Vietnam
This project analyzes the wellbeing of children in low and middle-income countries, specifically Ethiopia and Vietnam, using various data science techniques. The project is based on the global study "Young Lives" which observed the lifestyles of 12,000 children over fifteen years. The goal is to gather evidence to guide decision-makers in creating programs that benefit underprivileged children and their families, addressing issues such as material poverty, addiction, and education.

## Data Science Techniques Used

### 1. Database Design and SQL Server 
- A database was designed to store and manage data from the Young Lives project. Data from Ethiopia and Vietnam were downloaded, converted from SPSS to CSV, and imported into an SQL Server database. Five views were created to segment the data into meaningful categories.

### 2. Data Visualization with Microsoft Power BI 
- The data was visualized using Microsoft Power BI, creating detailed reports and dashboards to present insights about child health, household characteristics, habits, education, and food security.

### 3. Statistical Analysis 
- Various statistical measures were used to analyze the data, such as calculating average BMI and vaccination rates, and comparing these across different demographics.

## Key Components

### 1. Database Design – SQL Server
- The database named young_lives was created, and data for Ethiopia and Vietnam were uploaded. Five views were created to segment the data: Child Health, Child Household, Child Habits, Child Education, and Child Food Security.

### 2. Reports – Microsoft Power BI Report Builder

#### 2.1 Children Health in Ethiopia and Vietnam
- Analyzed child health based on vaccinations (BCG, measles, tetanus) and BMI. The report concluded that proper vaccination and maintaining a healthy BMI are crucial for better health.
#### 2.2 Children Household in Ethiopia and Vietnam
- Explored household characteristics such as household size, head of household's sex and age, education, land, and house ownership.
#### 2.3 Child Habit in Ethiopia and Vietnam
- Investigated smoking and alcohol consumption habits among children under 18 and their correlation with household characteristics.
#### 2.4 Child Education in Ethiopia and Vietnam
- Assessed educational attainment and literacy among children, including school enrollment, reading and writing levels, and daily activities.
#### 2.5 Child’s Food Security in Ethiopia and Vietnam
- Evaluated food security and its impact on child health, including underweight, stunting, thinness, and BMI.

### 3. Dashboard Design - Microsoft Power BI

#### Child Poverty Monitor
- A comprehensive dashboard with visualizations on child health, household characteristics, habits, education, and food security. The dashboard provides interactive elements such as maps, slicers, and charts to facilitate in-depth analysis.
